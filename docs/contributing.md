## How to contribute

Thanks for looking here! We'd love your help. The micro:bit project is only
possible through contributions of companies and individuals around the world.

This project is managed [in this GitHub project](https://github.com/microbit-foundation/microbit-fs), and the best way to contribute
is to jump in and fix/file issues.

## Code of conduct

Trust, partnership, simplicity and passion are our core values we live and
breathe in our daily work life and within our projects. Our open-source
projects are no exception. We have an active community which spans the globe
and we welcome and encourage participation and contributions to our projects
by everyone. We work to foster a positive, open, inclusive and supportive
environment and trust that our community respects the micro:bit code of
conduct. Please see our [code of conduct](https://microbit.org/safeguarding/)
which outlines our expectations for all those that participate in our
community and details on how to report any concerns and what would happen
should breaches occur.
