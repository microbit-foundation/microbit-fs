# micro:bit Filesystem

<img alt="microbit-fs logo" src="img/microbit-fs-logo.png" style="max-width: 250px">

This is the documentation for the micro:bit Filesystem library.

This library can be used to add files with Python code (or any other content)
into a MicroPython hex file, ready to be loaded into a micro:bit.

The reverse process is also supported, being able to read the files encoded in
the MicroPython filesystem from a hex file.

This library can also generate [Universal
Hex](https://github.com/microbit-foundation/spec-universal-hex) files to create
a singe hex that can be loaded in any micro:bit board.
